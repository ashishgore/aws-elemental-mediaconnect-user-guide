*Offerings* are discounts that MediaConnect offers in exchange for a commitment to use a certain amount of outbound bandwidth each month\. The components of a MediaConnect offering are:
+ Duration
+ Outbound bandwidth
+ Price \(billed hourly\)

When you purchase an offering, you specify the start date and time\. The resulting resource is called a *reservation* because you are "reserving" a certain amount of outbound bandwidth for a period of time\.

*Outbound bandwidth* refers to data that is transferred from a MediaConnect flow to a location or endpoint outside of the AWS Cloud\. It does not include data transferred *in* to your MediaConnect flow, nor does it include data transferred from a MediaConnect flow to any location within the AWS Cloud\.
